# CBMC Formal Verification Results

CBMC (C Bounded Model Checker) formal verification results for critical cryptographic functions.

## Overview

CBMC is used to verify memory safety, bounds checking, and pointer safety in critical cryptographic code paths.

## Verification Results

### kernel_crypto_aes_impl - Critical Encryption/Decryption Function

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**CBMC Version:** 5.95.1  
**Function Verified:** `process_data_harness` (extracted from `kernel_crypto_aes_impl::process_data`)

**Verification Parameters:**
- Bounds checking: Enabled (`--bounds-check`)
- Pointer checking: Enabled (`--pointer-check`)
- Unwind limit: 50 iterations
- Maximum data size: 1024 bytes
- Maximum key size: 32 bytes

**Results: VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL**

#### Array Bounds Verification (4 checks)
- `input` array lower bound access: **SUCCESS**
- `input` array upper bound access: **SUCCESS**
- `key` array lower bound access: **SUCCESS**
- `key` array upper bound access: **SUCCESS**

#### Pointer Safety Verification (18 checks)
- Output pointer dereference safety (NULL, invalid, deallocated, dead, out-of-bounds, invalid address): **6 checks SUCCESS**
- Input pointer dereference safety (NULL, invalid, deallocated, dead, out-of-bounds, invalid address): **6 checks SUCCESS**
- Key pointer dereference safety (NULL, invalid, deallocated, dead, out-of-bounds, invalid address): **6 checks SUCCESS**

#### Assertion Verification (1 check)
- Postcondition assertion (`output != NULL`): **SUCCESS**

**Summary:** **0 of 23 verification conditions failed**

## Verification Coverage

### Properties Verified

1. **Memory Safety:**
   - No buffer overflows (input, output, key arrays)
   - No underflows (array access bounds)
   - No NULL pointer dereferences
   - No invalid pointer dereferences
   - No use-after-free (deallocated objects)
   - No dead object access

2. **Bounds Checking:**
   - Array index within valid range
   - Key index computation safe (modulo operation)
   - Loop bounds respected

3. **Pointer Safety:**
   - All pointer dereferences are safe
   - Pointers remain valid throughout execution
   - No out-of-bounds access

## Limitations

1. **Bounded Verification:**
   - Verification is bounded (up to 1024 bytes data, 32 bytes key)
   - Loops unwound up to 50 iterations
   - For larger inputs, verification may not cover all cases

2. **Simplified Model:**
   - Test harness extracts core logic from C++ implementation
   - System calls and GNU Radio framework not included
   - Focus on critical cryptographic operations

3. **Functional Correctness:**
   - Memory safety verified, but not cryptographic correctness
   - XOR operation verified safe (for testing purposes)
   - Actual AES implementation handled by kernel crypto API

## Recommendations

1. **For Complete Verification:**
   - Verify full C++ implementation with appropriate tools (Frama-C, etc.)
   - Verify system call integration separately
   - Consider property-based testing for functional correctness

2. **For Production:**
   - Memory safety verified for critical path
   - Continue using kernel crypto API for actual AES operations
   - Maintain bounds checking in production code

## Running Verification

```bash
cd tests/cbmc
cbmc kernel_crypto_aes_harness.c --bounds-check --pointer-check --unwind 50
```
