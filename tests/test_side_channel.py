Side-Channel Analysis Tests for gr-linux-crypto.

Tests for timing attacks, constant-time operations, and side-channel vulnerabilities.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- These tests measure timing at the Python level and are limited by Python overhead
- Python garbage collection, scheduling, and overhead can mask or create false positives
- These tests are CONCEPTUAL and DOCUMENT timing characteristics
- For true side-channel analysis, use specialized tools on the C implementation:
  * dudect (https://github.com/oreparaz/dudect) for C code
  * Hardware power analysis for hardware implementations
- The underlying cryptographic libraries (OpenSSL, Python cryptography) should be
  side-channel resistant, but this should be verified through proper analysis

These tests serve to:
1. Document timing characteristics
2. Provide framework for side-channel awareness
3. Detect obvious issues
4. Guide proper side-channel analysis methodology
